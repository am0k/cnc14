// Forgive the lack of completion, as my book was supposed to arrive Saturday (October 4th)
// but instead will get here Monday afternoon. Well after this Homework is due.

6. 	a) The function is total and one-to-one. However, it is not onto since the range
		is the set of even numbers.
	
	b) The function is total and onto. It is not one-to-one since f(0) = f(1) = 0.
	
	c) The function is total, one-to-one, and onto but not the identity.

	d) The function maps the even natural numbers onto the entire set of natural numbers. 
		It is not a total function from N to N, since it is not defined for odd natural 
		numbers.

10.


22. 	Since Diagonalization is used to prove that there are AN uncountable number of 
		monotone increasing functions, we can then assume that the set of monotone increasing
		functions is countable. 

		But if we can show that there is at least one monotone increasing function that is not
		in the listing, then the assumption that the monotone increasing functions comprise a 
		countable set leads to a contradiction and we can then conclude that the set is uncoutable.

46. a) The depth of the tree is 4.
	b) The set of ancestors of x11 is fx11; x7; x2; x1g.
	c) The minimal common ancestor of x14 and x11 is x2; of x15 and x11 is x1.
	d) The subtree generated by x2 is comprised of the arcs [x2; x5], [x2; x6], [x2; x7], [x5; x10],
		[x7; x11], and [x10; x14].
	e) The frontier is the set fx14; x6; x11; x3; x8; x12; x15; x16g.
